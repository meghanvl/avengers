## Overview 
The purpose of this project is to determine if there is a correlation between crime and hotel ratings in Kansas City, MO; New Orleans, LA; Dallas, TX; Portland, OR; Charlottesville, VA; Chicago, IL; Denver, CO; Sioux Falls, SD; Las Vegas, NV; San Francisco, CA; Chattanooga, TN; and Boston, MA.  

Question 1: What is the crime rate of each city?<br>
Question 2: What are the hotel ratings for each city?   
Question 3: Are hotel ratings lower in areas with a higher crime rating? 

Our hypothesis is that a hotel will have a lower rating in areas where the crime rate is higher. We will analyize crime and hotel statistics from five different cities of similar populations.
